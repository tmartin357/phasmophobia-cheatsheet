					<br/>
					<p>This is a fork of un0btanium's Phasmophobia CheatSheet, with some adjustments I made for my playstyle. You can find the original project <a href="https://github.com/un0btanium/phasmophobia-cheatsheet">here</a>. The original about page continues below.</p>
					<p>Phasmophobia CheatSheet provides an interactive 2D grid overview about all ghost types and their evidence. Add evidence to rule out ghosts and narrow down your search. If you set your game to Borderless Fullscreen window mode, you can quickly Alt+TAB in and out of your game.</p>
					<p>Special thanks to Redforce04, aschlick, thijnmens & Buguslavv for contributing on GitHub and keeping the project up-to-date.</p>
